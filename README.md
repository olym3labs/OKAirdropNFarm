The "OK Airdrop N Farm" program is designed to provide vocational students with hands-on experience in blockchain technology. 

By participating, students will gain practical knowledge of decentralized finance (DeFi), including token airdrops and yield farming.

This initiative aims to bridge the gap between theoretical learning and real-world application by offering students the opportunity to experiment with blockchain platforms in a guided, educational setting. 

Through "OK Airdrop N Farm," participants will not only earn tokens but also learn how blockchain can be used for financial inclusion, smart contracts, and decentralized governance. 

The program emphasizes active learning, equipping students with valuable skills that are increasingly in demand in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.
